- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Ottski
- Iâ€™m a biologist by title but a data analyst at heart. 
- For the last 10 years I've worked as a Fisheries Biologist where I've been responsible for the development and implementation of management programs related to the conservation and recreation of fish species throughout NJ. 
- My passion for biology is coupled with a passion of finding and understanding patterns. I'm continually developing my knowledge of coding in R, statistical modeling, and interpreting biological data related to fisheries conservation issues.
